## ✨ Project Description

Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate web developer, this project will help you improve your front-end skills and learn how to add 3D elements to your portfolio.


## 🔧 What You’ll Learn:

- HTML Structure & Semantics:
  Learn how to build a clean and accessible HTML layout using semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <main>. This ensures both SEO and screen-reader friendliness.
  
- CSS Styling Fundamentals:
  You'll style the page using modern CSS practices including variables, flexbox (df-c-sb, df-c-fc, etc.), typography controls, hover effects, transitions, and background settings to create a premium Apple-inspired feel.

- Responsive Layout with Media Queries:
  Implement responsive design techniques using media queries, ensuring your portfolio is mobile-friendly across all screen sizes (like tablets and mobile phones). Hamburger menu integration is also included.

- Animated UI Using Animate.css:
  Add smooth and elegant animations with animate.css, including fade-ins and delays for a polished and professional look. Animations are used for text, navigation, and thumbnails.

- Interactive Elements with JavaScript:
  Users can click on different iPhone thumbnails to dynamically load 3D iPhone models using Sketchfab iframes, replacing the default video. This is handled through event listeners, dynamic iframe generation, and DOM manipulation.
